# MyBlockchain project

The project inspired by article [Learn Blockchains by Building One](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46)

Repository contains base Blockchain which can proof transactions using Proof-of-Work algorithm. Also there is a 
possibility to run a few nodes of this blockchain.

I wish to respect author of this article [Daniel van Flymen](https://hackernoon.com/@vanflymen) who had written perfect
topic.
